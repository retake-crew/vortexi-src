# Vortexi Source Code

Please, I beg. Change the frontend code so you stand out. Thanks!

This is the original Vortexi source code with much needed improvements.

This was made with love by [me](https://kaitlyn.codes).

Any support, please [contact me](https://kaitlyn.codes) or [copyright.txt on Discord](https://discord.com/users/744379641707626556)!

Good luck, feel free to rehost this!

If you wanna play Vortexi for whatever reason without either rehosting it yourself or finding a revival that uses it, [here you go](https://vortexi.cc).
